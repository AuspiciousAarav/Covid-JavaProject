## Covid-JavaProject
Hi my name is Aarav Shah, and I created this coding project because I wanted to warn people about this COVID-19 situation! I am a beginner at Java, so plz feel free to send your feedback by dming me on Discord: advanced core#3832, or send me an email at [aaravshah001@hotmail.com](aaravshah001@hotmail.com), if you want the code do it yourself.

To run it plz type: 
$ java -jar COVID2.jar 
to run it in the terminal! Dont forget to make sure you are in the directory where the file is
